A Discord Bot is a Discord bot that uses Linear Regression Machine Learning model to help properly react to when a member of a discord server properly informs the other members of the server that it is time to play [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/).

If the message has an easily regexable or searchable text fragment it's checked first using regex, `str.__contains__`, or equality before falling back to the ML Model to help boost accuracy. 
Any message the ML Model is the sole source of flagging will be reacted to with the ðŸ¤– emoji.

## Motivation  

The motivation of this bot was to have a bot that automatically responds with reactions on a message and posts a gif in response to a message containing multiple `a`'s at the end of a message or a message that is only `'a'`. These are both used in a Discord Server I am in to signal to the others that it is time to play Overwatch.

Also I kinda wanted to make a basic Discord Bot for fun.
